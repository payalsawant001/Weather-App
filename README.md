🌦️ Built a fully functional and responsive Weather App using pure HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for any city and instantly fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API via Axios. It displays key weather details including city name, temperature in Celsius, 'feels like' temperature, and a descriptive condition (e.g., clear sky, rain), along with a relevant weather icon.

The user interface is clean and modern, featuring a soft gradient background, rounded input fields, hover animations, and a neatly structured weather card. The entire application is front-end only and does not rely on any frameworks or back-end services, making it lightweight and easy to deploy on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.

🔧 Tech Stack:  
• HTML5  
• CSS3 with Bootstrap 5  
• JavaScript (Vanilla)  
• Axios (for API calls)  
• OpenWeatherMap API  

✅ Features:  
• Search weather by city name  
• Real-time temperature and weather description  
• Weather condition icons  
• Responsive layout for desktop and mobile  
• Error handling for invalid cities  

This project is ideal for beginners learning API integration and responsive front-end development. More features like geolocation-based weather, history of searches, and dynamic backgrounds can be added in future iterations.
